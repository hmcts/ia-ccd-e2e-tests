It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.","reported_by":null,"title":"Babel has inefficient RegExp complexity in generated code with .replace when transpiling named capturing groups","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2025-27789"],"access":"public","severity":"moderate","module_name":"@babel/runtime-corejs3","vulnerable_versions":"<7.26.10","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 7.26.10 or later","patched_versions":">=7.26.10","updated":"2025-04-16T15:39:52.000Z","cvss":{"score":6.2,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cwe":["CWE-1333"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8"},"1104663":{"findings":[{"version":"5.1.0","paths":["pre-commit>cross-spawn"]}],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21538\n- https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/pull/160\n- https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/5ff3a07d9add449021d806e45c4168203aa833ff\n- https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/640d391fde65388548601d95abedccc12943374f\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CROSSSPAWN-8303230\n- https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/issues/165\n- https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/d35c865b877d2f9ded7c1ed87521c2fdb689c8dd\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-8366349\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xgq-45jj-v275","created":"2024-11-08T06:30:47.000Z","id":1104663,"npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"Versions of the package cross-spawn before 7.0.5 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper input sanitization.
