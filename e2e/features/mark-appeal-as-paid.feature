  Scenario: End HU appeal on payment incomplete

    And I save my initial HU appeal type with no remission and without hearing fee and pay offline
    And I submit my nonpayment appeal

    When I click the `Overview` tab
    And I should see the text `Do this next`
    And I should see the text `You still need to pay for this appeal. You will soon receive a notification with instructions on how to pay by card online.`

    Then I switch to be a `Admin Officer`
    And I end the appeal
    Then I should only see the `caseOfficer_appealEnded` case progress image
    And I should see the text `What happens next`
    And I should see the text `No further action required, unless either party asks for the decision to be reviewed by a judge.`
    And I should see the ended appeal details
