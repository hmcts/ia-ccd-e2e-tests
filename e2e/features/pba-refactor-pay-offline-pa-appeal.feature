  Scenario: Pay by card (offline) after submitting appeal (PA appeal type)

    When I click the `Overview` tab
    Then I should only see the `progress_legalRep_appealSubmitted` case progress image
    And I should see the text `Do this next`
    And I should see the text `You have submitted your appeal. A Tribunal Caseworker will now review your appeal.`

    When I click the `Appeal` tab
    Then I should see `Refusal of protection claim` for the `Type of appeal` field
    And I should see `Decision with a hearing. The fee for this type of appeal is Â£140` for the `How do you want the appeal to be decided?` field
    And I should see `Pay after submitting the appeal by card` for the `Payment method` field

    When I click the `Overview` tab
    And I select the `Make a payment` Next step
    Then I should see the text `Errors`
    And I should see the text `The Make a payment option is not available.`

    When I select the `Change payment method to card` Next step
    Then I should see the text `Errors`
    And I should see the text `You can only change the payment method to card following a failed payment using Payment by Account.`
