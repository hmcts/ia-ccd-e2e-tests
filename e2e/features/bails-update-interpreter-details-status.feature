Feature: Bails Update interpreter details application as Legal Rep
  Background:
    Given I am signed in as a `Legal Org User Rep A Bails`
    When I create a new bail application
    Then I save my initial application as a `Legal Rep` for a Immigration removal centre detention with two financial condition supporters and with a Legal Representative with no files uploaded
    And I submit my bail application as a `Legal Rep`

    Then I should see the text `Update interpreter details`
    When I Add the bail interpreter details
